# CSCI 466 Programming Assignment - Battleship Network ApplicationÂ 

## Instructions
### Due: 12/12/17 11:59PM


Complete the following assignment in pairs, or groups of three. 
Submit your work on D2L into the "Programming Assignment 1" folder. 
All partners will submit the same solution and we will only grade one solution for each group.


## Learning Objectives

In this programming assignment you will:

- Write a client-server application
- Communicate using HTTP
- Design a messaging standard


## Overview

In this lab you will write a distributed implementation of the 
[Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)).
We will use the standard [10x10 variation of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)#Description).
Here is an [online implementation](http://www.battleshiponline.org/) of the Battleship game.
*Note that the ships in that implementation have slightly different names.*

Our implementation will be based on a symmetric client server architecture, where each player has both a server and a client.
The server keeps an internal state of the game and issues replies to the other player's client.



##Board Setup

The first step before the game begins is the setup of the board, according to the [rules of the game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)#Description).
We will represent the board with a character array, where `_` represents water and Carrier, Battleship, cRuiser, Submarine, and Destroyer fields are represented by `C`, `B`, `R`, `S`, `D` respectively. 
For example, your board might be set up as follows:

```
CCCCC_____
BBBB______
RRR_______
SSS_______
D_________
D_________
__________
__________
__________
__________
```

You will save your board as `board.txt`.

###Messages

In class we will design a set of messages to be exchanged between the client and the server.
The `fire` message needs to communicate the grid location of salvo.
The `result` message needs to communicate whether the salvo was a hit, a sink, or a miss.

Here is the format of messages we will use.
The `fire` message will be represented as an `HTTP POST` request.
The content of the fire message will include the targeted coordinates as a [URL formatted string for Web forms](\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms), for example 5 and 7, as: `x=5\&y=7`.
Assume that coordinates are 0-indexed.

The `result` message will be formatted as an HTTP response.
For a correctly formatted `fire` request your reply will be an `HTTP OK` message with `hit=` followed by `1` (hit), or `0` (miss).
If the hit results in a sink, then the response will also include `sink=` followed by a letter code (`C`, `B`, `R`, `S`, `D`) of the sunk ship.
An example of such a reply is `hit=1\&sink=D`.

If the fire message includes coordinates that are out of bounds, the response will be `HTTP Not Found`.
If the fire message includes coordinates that have been already fired opon, the response will be `HTTP GONE`.
Finally, if the fire message is not formatted correctly, the response will be `HTTP Bad Request`.
For your reference here's a [link](\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) to the different HTTP response status codes.


###Program Invocation

Your server process should accept a port parameter, on which a client can connect, and the file containing the setup of your board, eg. 

`python server.py 5000 board.txt`.

Your client process should accept the IP address, the port of the server process, and the X and Y coordinates onto which to fire, eg. 

`python client.py 128.111.52.245 5000 5 7`.

The client will be invoked multiple times during the game.


###Internal State Representation
Following each `fire` message the server should update the state of the player's board (whether a player's ship has been hit and where).
Following each `result` message the client should update the record of the player's shots onto the opponent's board.
A player should be able able to visually inspect their own board and their record of opponent's board on `\url{http://localhost:5000/own_board.html` and `\url{http://localhost:5000/opponent_board.html` respectively.
It is up to you how you visually represent the state of each board, however, I will award __one bonus point__ to the group with the most visually appealing representation.


###BONUS
I will also award __one bonus point__ to any group that implements the Version 1 rules of the [Battleship: Advanced Missions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Battleship:_Advanced_Mission) variant of the game.

##What to Submit


* \[2 points\] Find a partner.
Submit `partners.txt` with your partner's, or partners' first and last name.

* \[3 points\] `message\_format.txt` -- A text file describing the message formats you are using in your implementation. 

* \[10 points\] `server.py` -- your working Python implementation of your server process.
Note: code that does not compile, or crashes will receive zero credit.

* \[10 points\] `client.py` -- your working Python implementation of your client process. 
Note: code that does not compile, or crashes will receive zero credit.

* \[1 points\] (BONUS) `client_am.py` and `server_am.py` -- implementing the Advanced Missions rules of the Battleship game.
Please also include `BONUS\_README.txt` that explains any changes into how the client program should be invoked.
